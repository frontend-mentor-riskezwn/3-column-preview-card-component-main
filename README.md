## My process

I have designed first adapting the web to mobile devices, so that later it would be easier to adapt it to the desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


```css
.box:first-child {
    border-radius: 0.5em 0.5em 0 0;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [:first-child and :last-child](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/first-child/) - This helped me round only the first and last element
